/**
 * Declare a class to represent dates (e.g., February 13, 2005). Consider the
 * following issues:
 * What operations should be supported?
 * Addition? Subtraction? Comparison?
 * Default construction?
 * Input? Output?
 * Should time be part of a date?
 * If so, what about time zone issues?
 * What is the resolution of time (e.g., seconds, microseconds, etc.)?
 Donâ€™t get hung up on how the class will be implemented. This is an
 exercise in design and declaration.
