'''
Given a string S, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

For example:

Given "aacecaaa", return "aaacecaaa".

Given "abcd", return "dcbabcd".

Notes:
Manacher's Algorithm for finding longest palindrome in string:

Till 11:43.


For this problem: 
I need to find longest palindrome  STARTING at index 0..i.
then append [i..n] in reverse order at beginning.


I'm using Kanacher's algorithm to find Longest palindrome substring, which
STARTS at index 0

In other words, palindrome center whose radius (left) touches 0.

For Mancher's algorithm update rule:

if len(mirror) goes beyond L:
    P[i] = (R-i)
else if its within L:
    P[i] = P[mirror]
expand beyond the minimum length from 1 and 2

In Manacherâ€™s algorithm, s is converted to a string newS splitted by #, for example abc -> #a#b#c#. And we know that p[i] is the len of palindrome whose center is newS[i], and i - P[i] is the actually LEFT of palindrome in s. So we only need to find the last i whose LEFT reaches the start of newS.
