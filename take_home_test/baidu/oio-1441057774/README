Glob

Problem
-------

Given a pattern and a list of filenames, return the filenames which
match the given pattern in a separate list. The pattern should support
two wild card characters '?' and '*', where '?' can match zero or one
characters and '*' can match any number of characters. For the sake of
simplicity, you can assume the input filenames only contain alphabets.

Instructions
------------

Building the binary

For Linux and Mac users, you can use the included Makefile to compile
and run the project.

~~~~ {.shell}
# Compile only
make
# Compile and run
make run
~~~~

For Windows Visual Studio users, a vcproj template is included.
Alternatively you can compile and run with the included Makefile.vs in
Developer Command Prompt:

~~~~ {.shell}
# cd to project directory
# Compile only
nmake -f Makefile.vs
# Compile and run
nmake -f Makefile.vs run
~~~~

Please find the skeleton code in the file project.cpp and implement the
Match function. Please avoid using any regex or glob modules/libraries.

For example,

~~~~ {.c}
// should return vector<string>({"abcd", "dabc", "abc"})
Glob().Match("?abc*", {"abcd", "dabc", "abc", "efabc"});
~~~~

Your solution will be scored in the descending priority of correctness,
memory & time complexity, and comprehensibility.

Submission
----------

Upon completion, please follow the instructions described in the website
(where you found the instructions to download the project) to submit
your solution. You can submit as many times as you prefer. Your last
submission will be used for evaluation as well as marking the end of
your coding assessment.

Lastly, do not be concerned if you are running a little bit over time
(0-10 minutes). We do not penalize moderately tardy submissions.
