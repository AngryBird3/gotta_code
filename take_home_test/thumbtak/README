CommandParser.py:
	* What does it do?
	- Read one line (or command)
	* Assumption:

Execute.py:
	* What does it do?
	- Parse raw string command
	- Issue execute operation/Command
	* Assumption:
	- Assuming commands are case sensitive; hence discarding what not 
	  I don't recognize (KNOWN_COMMANDS)
	- If there are more arguments than expected; ignore
	- If the command isn't complete - or in other words less arguments 
	  then don't do anything - ignore that command	

Database.py
	* What does it do?
	- Store data (key/value), keep list of transactions which are not
	  committed (top one being latest/current)
	* Assumption
	- Commit/Rollback:
		- If we don't have any open transaction, it will simply return
	      (after printing NO TRANSACTION)
	- Get:
		If no open transaction then read from database
	- Set:
		If no open transaction then assume we've opened one
	- Unset:
		if no open transaction then unset from database
